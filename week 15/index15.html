	<div class="grid-item grid-item7" class="grid-item" title="poem1"> <b> This City Made Me</b> <br> <br> We grew here and you flew here. The concreate pavement raised me when adults weren't looking. When i tumbled to the ground it kissed my skin and reminded me that life can only go up. People shuffled through train cars carrying the stench of cigarrettes and marijuana. Ladies pushing icy carts yelling <b>"coco, mango, cherry!"</b> after school made the end of spring semester worth it. Show time performers inspired kids to join gymnastics not realizing they had to teach themselves those tricks on playground jungle gyms. It's not about Times Square, or Rockerfeller Center, or Wall Street. It's not about trying to find the best hotel that gives you a view of the Ball Dropping on New Years Eve. It's about <em>YOU </em>. Did it make you who you are today? </div>

	<div class="grid-item grid-item9" class="grid-item" title="poem2"> <b>Hope</b> <br> <br> As a child the world is a place to be explored. When there is an unknown what do we do ? We jump head first into the void because there is no predisposition to fear. We learn about fear when we grow up. As kids we are as free as can be. Growing in a city with mountains of unknowns we learn how to navigate the void. </div>
